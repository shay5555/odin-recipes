    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together vanilla instant pudding mix, cream and milk. Cover and refrigerate to set.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil. 
                Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball. 
                Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. 
                Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. 
                Drop by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them a couple of inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. 
                Centers should be dry.</li>
            <li>When the shells are cool, either split and fill them with the pudding mixture, 
                or use a pastry bag to pipe the pudding into the shells.</li>
        </ol>
